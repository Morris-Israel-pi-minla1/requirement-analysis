# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding the principles and practices of Requirement Analysis in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). It covers key concepts, activities, and documentation techniques using a booking management system as a case study.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of discovering, analyzing, defining, and documenting the requirements for a software system. It's a critical early stage in the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** that acts as a bridge between stakeholders (like clients and users) and the development team. The primary goal is to ensure that the final product meets the actual needs of the users and solves the intended problem.

This process involves translating vague user requests into detailed, measurable, and testable specifications. Without a thorough analysis, a project risks facing scope creep, budget overruns, and ultimately, failure to deliver a useful product. ðŸ˜¥
